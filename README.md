This Python program simulates a laptop repair intake system that processes daily repair data using various data structures and operations.
VS Code Implementation Steps
step1:- Created a new Python file (`laptop_repair.py`)
- Imported the `array` module for efficient numeric storage

1. Integers Section
Procedure: Created a list of daily laptop intake counts for 7 days
- Operation: Calculated total, average, minimum, and maximum values
- VS Code Features Used: Variable watching in debug mode to monitor calculations

 2. Strings Section
- Procedure: Used f-strings to create a formatted report
- VS Code Features: Syntax highlighting for string formatting, multi-line string creation

3. Booleans Section
- Procedure: Implemented threshold checking with compound condition
- VS Code Features: Conditional breakpoints to test boolean logic

4. Lists Section
-Procedure: 
  - Displayed original list
  - Added new element using `.append()`
  - Filtered out values below threshold using list comprehension
  - Sorted the final list
- VS Code Features: Step-through debugging to observe list modifications

5. Arrays Section
-Procedure:
  - Created fixed-size array from list subset
  - Compared array sum with list sum for verification
- VS Code Features: Type checking to ensure proper array usage

6.Dictionaries Section
- Procedure:
  - Created list of dictionary records
  - Updated specific record by index
  - Filtered records using list comprehension
  - Calculated total values across records
- VS Code Features: Dictionary value inspection during debugging

Key VS Code Procedures Used

1. Debugging: Set breakpoints at each section to verify calculations
2. Variable Inspection: Used debug panel to monitor data structure changes
3. Terminal Output: Ran script multiple times to verify output formatting
4. Code Formatting: Used VS Code's auto-formatter for consistent style
5. Error Checking: Utilized Python extension for syntax validation

Output Verification
The program produces:
- Formatted report with statistics
- Status message based on threshold
- Before/after list comparisons
- Array vs list sum verification
- Updated dictionary records with total

Testing in VS Code
- Ran the script using `Ctrl+F5` (Run without debugging)
